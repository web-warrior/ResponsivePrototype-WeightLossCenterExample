# ResponsivePrototype-WeightLossCenterExample

This prototype example was built in 6 hours as a code challenge to demonstrate ability to build a 
responsive layout from scratch with pure HTML and CSS.

The design was submitted as a static .jpg file that required me to slice and dice the images as needed for the layout.

I completed as much of the layout as possible with as many responsive transitions as possible and used my own
best judgment for hover transitions.

I had to come up with the 2nd, and 3rd text copy for the slider transitions in the header to demonstrate a sense 
of audience engagement and appropriate wording choices for site topics that would be relevant.

There are some small things that were not completed but the entire responsive layout is complete.
