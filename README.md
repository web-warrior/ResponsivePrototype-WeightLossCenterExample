# ResponsivePrototype-WeightLossCenterExample

The design was submitted to me as a static .jpg file that required me to slice and dice the images as needed for the layout.

This prototype example was built in 8 hours as a code challenge to demonstrate ability to build a 
responsive layout with pure HTML and CSS. 

I used a stripped down version of Susy grid to rapidly implement a grid to speed up the responsive development.

I referenced font awesome for the mobile menu icon and Adobe Typekit to closely resemble the fonts selected in the mockup.

I completed the layout with responsive transitions and used my own best judgment for hover transitions.

I had to come up with the 2nd, and 3rd text copy for the slider transitions in the header to demonstrate a sense 
of audience engagement and appropriate wording choices for site topics that would be relevant.

There are some small things that were not completed but the entire responsive layout is complete.

This may look simplistic but once you start coding and building out the responsive parts it quickly becomes a challenge.
